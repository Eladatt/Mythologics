Anesthesia Considerations:
- Induction: Propofol (1.5-2.5 mg/kg IV) for rapid induction and quick recovery.
- Maintenance: Isoflurane or sevoflurane with oxygen. Consider using dexmedetomidine for its neuroprotective effects.
- Physiological considerations: Maintain cerebral blood flow and manage intracranial pressure.
- Monitoring: Continuous EEG monitoring, cerebral oximetry, and intracranial pressure monitoring when applicable.
- Recovery: Close monitoring in PACU, especially for oxygenation, ventilation, and potential cognitive effects.
- Special considerations: Use of neuroprotective strategies, careful titration of anesthetics to maintain optimal cerebral perfusion.

Summary Table Row:
Brain | Propofol (1.5-2.5 mg/kg IV) for induction, isoflurane or sevoflurane with dexmedetomidine for maintenance | Sensitive to changes in cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure | Close PACU monitoring, continuous EEG and cerebral oximetry, neuroprotective strategies

  Anesthesia Considerations:
- Induction: Alfaxalone (12 mg/kg) or propofol (10 mg/kg), similar to protocols for large reptiles.
- Physiological considerations: Three-chambered heart, temperature-dependent metabolism, periods of anaerobic metabolism.
- Monitoring: Heart rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation are crucial.
- Recovery: Monitor in a warmed, quiet environment for up to 24 hours due to potential for prolonged recovery.
- Special equipment: Heat-resistant monitoring devices and intubation equipment for long neck and potential fire breath.

Summary Table Row:
Dragon | Alfaxalone (12 mg/kg) or propofol (10 mg/kg) for induction | Three-chambered heart, temperature-dependent metabolism, anaerobic metabolism periods | Monitor in warmed environment for up to 24 hours, use heat-resistant equipment

Anesthesia Considerations:
- Induction: Combination of ketamine (5 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.2 mg/kg) IV, similar to equine protocols.
- Maintenance: Inhalant anesthetics (isoflurane or sevoflurane) with oxygen.
- Monitoring: Magic-resistant equipment for vital signs, especially for monitoring magical metabolism.
- Recovery: Provide a quiet, dimly lit area. Monitor for any magical side effects.
- Special considerations: Horn protection during procedures, careful drug dosing due to potential magical interactions.

Summary Table Row:
Unicorn | Ketamine (5 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.2 mg/kg) IV for induction, isoflurane or sevoflurane for maintenance | Magical metabolism, potential for magical interactions | Quiet recovery area, monitor for magical side effects, use magic-resistant equipment

Anesthesia Considerations:
- Induction: Propofol (4-6 mg/kg IV) for rapid induction.
- Maintenance: Isoflurane or sevoflurane with oxygen, using fireproof equipment.
- Analgesia: Fentanyl (2-4 μg/kg IV) for pain management.
- Monitoring: Continuous temperature monitoring is crucial. Use heat-resistant equipment.
- Recovery: Monitor in a fireproof area. Be prepared for potential spontaneous combustion and regeneration.
- Special considerations: Regeneration-aware drug protocols, temperature management to prevent accidental rebirth.

Summary Table Row:
Phoenix | Propofol (4-6 mg/kg IV) for induction, isoflurane or sevoflurane for maintenance, fentanyl (2-4 μg/kg IV) for analgesia | High body temperature, potential for spontaneous combustion and regeneration | Fireproof recovery area, continuous temperature monitoring, regeneration-aware protocols
